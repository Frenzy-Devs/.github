# Frenzy Devs  

**Frenzy Devs** is a crew of builders who thrive in controlled chaos—  
shipping fast, breaking limits, and turning wild ideas into working products.  

### Who We Are
We’re not an “agency.” We’re not a “team.”  
We’re a swarm of devs who actually *enjoy* the madness of building, breaking and fixing.  
When something looks impossible, that’s our starting point.  

### What We Do
- Ship MVPs before the coffee gets cold  
- Hack, refactor, repeat—until it *just works*  
- Treat bugs as puzzles, not problems  
- Build tools, apps, and experiments that refuse to stay in the box  

### Motto
` *“Chaos isn’t a bug—it’s the feature.”* `

## Join the Frenzy
